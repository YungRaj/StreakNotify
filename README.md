# StreakNotify
A jailbreak tweak that notifies the user when a snapchat streak is about to end and how much time one has to respond before the streak will end.

A clock emoji and time remaining will show up on your feed for a person you have not replied to and a streak is valid.

Notifications will be pushed based on intervals that you specify in settings

Custom Friends allows notifications to be enabled for those specified in Friendmojilist settings 

# Features coming soon
1. Auto send snaps which keep the streak for you after receiving the notification
2. Custom pictures you can send to keep the streak 
3. Integration with Phantom and Snap+
4. Ability to install on a non-jailbroken device
Note: you wonâ€™t be able to receive updates unless you check out the project I have frequently as updates are pushed. 
5. Information on your feed on whether custom friends is enabled for a specific person on your friends list.
6. Better integration with other view controllers such as ContactsViewController and FriendsViewController

# Note:
beta-testing branch is for beta testing new features to tweak
